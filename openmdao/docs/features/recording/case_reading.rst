**************************
Working with Recorded Data
**************************

A `CaseReader` class is provided to read the data from a case recorder file. Currently, OpenMDAO only has a
single format of `CaseRecorder`, `SqliteRecorder`.  In the future, we will implement an `HDF5Recorder`, but `CaseReader`
will work for any kind of recorded file, as it abstracts away the underlying file format.

Here is some simple code showing how to use the `CaseReader` class.

.. code-block:: console

    from openmdao.recorders.case_reader import CaseReader

    cr = CaseReader(case_recorder_filename)

Depending on how the cases were recorded and what options were set on the recorder, the case recorder file could contain
any of the following:

    #. Driver metadata
    #. System metadata
    #. Solver metadata
    #. Driver iterations
    #. System iterations
    #. Solver iterations

Assume that a recorder was attached to the `Driver` for the `Problem`. To find out how many cases were recorded:

.. code-block:: console

    print('Number of driver cases recorded =', cr.driver_cases.num_cases )

You can get a list of the case IDs using the `list_cases` method:

.. code-block:: console

    case_keys = cr.driver_cases.list_cases()
    for case_key in case_keys:
        print('Case:', case_key)

The `get_case` method provides a way to get at individual cases. The argument to this method can either be:

    #. Integer - in which case the argument is an index into the cases. Negative numbers can be used as indices just
            as is normally done in Python.
    #. String - in which case the argument is one of the case keys.

For example, in the common situation where the user wants to see the last case, they can do

.. code-block:: console

    last_case = cr.driver_cases.get_case(-1)
    print('Last value of pz.z =', last_case.desvars['z'])

Or, if the case key is known:

.. code-block:: console

    seventh_slsqp_iteration_case = cr.driver_cases.get_case('rank0:SLSQP|6')
    print('Value of pz.z after 7th iteration of SLSQP =', seventh_slsqp_iteration_case.desvars['z'])

Note that we access variables in the case reader through the promoted names instead of the absolute variable name.
If we had not promoted `pz.z`, we would use:

.. code-block:: console

    seventh_slsqp_iteration_case = cr.driver_cases.get_case('rank0:SLSQP|6')
    print('Value of pz.z after 7th iteration of SLSQP =', seventh_slsqp_iteration_case.desvars['pz.z'])

If a user would like to access the user-defined metadata on a given system or the scaling factors, the CaseReader also has a `system_metadata` dictionary. Note that the case recorder does need to be explicitly added to a system in order for its metadata to be recorded. Accessing this data for `pz` would look like:

.. code-block:: console

    pz_metadata = cr.system_metadata['pz']['component_metadata']
    pz_scaling = cr.system_metadata['pz']['scaling_factors']

Finally, if a user would like to access variable metadata there is a `output2meta` dictionary and a `input2meta` dictionary on the CaseReader. For example, if the user wanted the units of the `pz.z` variable they would use:

.. code-block:: console

    z_units = cr.output2meta['z']['units']

*Iterating Over Cases*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :code:`get_cases` method provides a way to iterate over Driver and Solver cases in order.

.. automethod:: openmdao.recorders.sqlite_reader.SqliteCaseReader.get_cases
    :noindex:

For example, if the user wanted to iterate over all Driver and Solver cases they would use:

.. code-block:: console

    for case in cr.get_cases(recursive=True):
        timestamp = case.timestamp
        ...

If the user wanted to iterate over all solver cases that are descendents of the first driver case they could use:

.. code-block:: console

    for case in cr.get_cases(parent='rank0:SLSQP|0', recursive=True):
        timestamp = case.timestamp
        ...

Note that this generator can return both Driver and Solver cases, which have different attributes.

*Listing Variables*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just like :ref:`listing variables <listing-variables>` on System objects, there is a :code:`list_inputs` method and a :code:`list_outputs` method.

.. automethod:: openmdao.recorders.sqlite_reader.SqliteCaseReader.list_inputs
    :noindex:

.. automethod:: openmdao.recorders.sqlite_reader.SqliteCaseReader.list_outputs
    :noindex:

These methods use System cases and thus will only return variables on systems which have the recorder attached. Using these methods is as simple as:

.. code-block:: console

    cr.list_inputs()
    cr.list_outputs()


By default, both methods will give all recorded variables and, if the `values` parameter is set to True, the last recorded value of each variable. Using the `case_id` parameter, however, enables listing inputs and outputs for a single system case. For example, listing the first and last system outputs recorded would be:

.. code-block:: console

    cr.list_outputs(case_id=0)
    cr.list_outputs(case_id=-1)

But you can also choose to use a specific iteration coordinate:

.. code-block:: console

    cr.list_inputs(case_id='rank0:SLSQP|0|root._solve_nonlinear|0')
